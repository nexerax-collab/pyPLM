    ### Welcome to Modern Software PLM
    
    In software development, managing complexity and change is critical‚Äîespecially when working on large, evolving products. 
    This is where Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) and Configuration Management (CM) come in.
    
    PLM helps track the entire lifecycle of a software product, from initial concept and development to deployment, maintenance, 
    and end-of-life. It ensures everyone involved‚Äîfrom engineers to stakeholders‚Äîhas a clear view of the current state of the 
    product, helping teams collaborate efficiently and make informed decisions.
    
    CM, a key part of PLM, focuses specifically on managing changes to the software and its related artifacts (like code, 
    documentation, and configurations). It ensures that every version and change is tracked, traceable, and controlled. 
    This prevents issues like code conflicts, missing dependencies, or misaligned releases‚Äîcommon problems in complex 
    development environments.
    
    Together, PLM and CM bring order and visibility to the software development process, enabling better quality, faster 
    delivery, and smoother coordination across teams.

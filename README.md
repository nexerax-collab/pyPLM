🛠️ PyPLM – Lightweight PLM System Powered by AI
PyPLM is a lightweight Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tool designed and built by a configuration manager & engineer — not a full-time developer.

I created this app using Google Colab, ChatGPT, and Streamlit, combining background knowledge from engineering and config management with the power of new AI tools. Despite having limited coding experience, this project shows what's now possible when domain expertise meets accessible AI.

🚀 Why This Exists
Modern AI lets anyone turn their ideas into real tools. 

My goal is to:

🌍 Make PyPLM freely available

🤝 Encourage community contribution

💡 Inspire others to build with their own expertise

This project is open to all — if you're an engineer, product owner, quality lead, or just curious, feel free to clone, contribute, and improve it.

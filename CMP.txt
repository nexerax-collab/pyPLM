Great! I’ll put together a basic, project-specific Configuration Management Plan template tailored for vehicle ECU software releases. It will cover all CM areas—version control, change management, baselines, audits, traceability—and align with relevant standards like ISO 10007 and EIA-649C. It’ll also be flexible enough to support different lifecycle models (V-model, Agile, ASPICE).

I’ll format it for easy editing in a Streamlit-based UI and let you know once it’s ready.

Configuration Management Plan for [Project Name]

Introduction

The Configuration Management (CM) Plan defines how configuration management activities are conducted for the [Project Name] ECU software. It ensures that all software configuration items (CIs) – such as source code, requirements, design documents, test cases, and tools – are identified, tracked, and controlled throughout the project lifecycle. This plan is aligned with industry standards (ISO 10007, ANSI/EIA-649C, IEEE 828) and Automotive SPICE guidelines for configuration management (SUP.8). It is tailored to a hybrid V-model/Agile development approach, meaning it supports both formal milestone baselines (per V-model stages) and iterative, incremental changes (per Agile sprints). All team members (CM specialists, software engineers, project leads, etc.) must adhere to this plan to maintain the integrity of the product configuration.

Scope: This plan covers all configuration management activities for the [Project Name] ECU software releases. It applies to all project phases (development, integration, release, and maintenance) and all work products under configuration control, including software components, relevant hardware or calibration data, documentation, and test artifacts. It defines how configuration management ensures consistency of the product’s functional and physical attributes with its requirements and design across the system’s life cycle.

Objectives: The primary objectives of CM are to establish and maintain the consistency and integrity of all identified items, provide traceability of changes, and ensure that only authorized, vetted changes are implemented. Effective configuration management supports the creation and maintenance of baselines, enabling successful development, testing, and release of the ECU software with a complete audit trail of design decisions and modifications. By following this plan, the project can “deliver what the customer has been promised” through rigorous change control and release management.

References: This plan is informed by the following standards and guides:

ISO 10007:2003 – Quality management systems – Guidelines for configuration management

ANSI/EIA-649C:2019 – National Consensus Standard for Configuration Management (provides CM principles and best practices)

IEEE Std 828-2012 – Standard for Configuration Management in Systems and Software Engineering (outlines requirements for CM plans including identification, change control, status accounting, and audits)

Automotive SPICE® v3.1 – SUP.8 Configuration Management (industry model for automotive software CM process and outcomes)

Terminology: Key CM terms used in this plan follow standard definitions for consistency: Configuration Item (CI) – an entity (software, document, etc.) placed under CM control; Baseline – a reference configuration of a product at a point in time, formally agreed upon, that serves as a basis for further development and can only be changed through change control; Change Request (CR) – a formal proposal for a modification; Configuration Control Board (CCB) – the group responsible for evaluating and approving changes; FCA/PCA – Functional and Physical Configuration Audits, etc. (See the Glossary at the end for additional definitions if needed.)

Roles and Responsibilities

Effective configuration management requires clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The following roles are involved in CM for [Project Name]:

Configuration Manager / CM Specialist: Responsible for overall configuration management planning and execution. Ensures this CM Plan is implemented and updated; administers CM tools and repositories; establishes baselines; monitors compliance with CM procedures; coordinates audits; and generates configuration status reports. This role also leads the CCB and is the point of contact for any CM issues.

Project Manager / Technical Lead: Ensures that CM policies are followed across the project. Chairs or delegates the CCB leadership with the CM Specialist, reviews and approves major baselines and releases, and provides resources and support for CM activities (e.g. scheduling audits, enforcing version control usage).

Software Developers: Follow CM procedures in their daily work. This includes checking code and artifacts into the version control system per defined naming conventions, branching/merging only as permitted, and linking changes to approved change requests. Developers are responsible for maintaining the integrity of their work products in the CM system and for promptly addressing any merge conflicts or build issues in line with the project’s branch strategy.

Quality Assurance (QA) / Test Engineers: Ensure that test cases and test results are placed under configuration control. Verify that the correct versions of software and test artifacts are used during testing (supporting traceability between requirements, code, and tests). QA may also participate in configuration audits and verify that release candidates meet the entry/exit criteria (e.g., all tests passed on a given baseline).

Configuration Control Board (CCB) Members: Typically a cross-functional team (could include the CM Specialist, Project Manager, lead developers, QA lead, etc.) responsible for evaluating change requests. The CCB reviews proposed changes for impact on scope, quality, and schedule, and either approves, defers, or rejects changes. They ensure only authorized changes are implemented and incorporated into baselines. The CCB’s composition, scope of authority, and procedures are defined in this plan (e.g., meeting cadence or on-demand e-meetings).

Stakeholders (e.g. System Engineers, Customers): In some cases, stakeholders may need to approve baselines or be informed of changes (especially if the project is part of a larger vehicle system integration). Their role is to provide necessary approvals (for example, sign-off on a formal release baseline) and to ensure the CM process aligns with higher-level system CM.

Note: Individual names are not listed here; instead, the project should maintain a RACI matrix or responsibility assignment table mapping these roles to actual team members or job titles. This matrix should be updated as personnel change. All team members must be aware of CM policies and be trained in the tools and procedures relevant to their role.

Configuration Identification

Configuration identification is the process of selecting, defining, and labeling the configuration items (CIs) to be managed for the project. In [Project Name], all items necessary to build the product or describe the product are placed under configuration control. This typically includes:

Software source code – all source files, build scripts, and configuration files required to compile the ECU software.

Requirements and design artifacts – specifications, models, or documents defining intended functionality and architecture.

Test artifacts – test plans, test cases, and test scripts for validating the software, along with test reports or results that need to be preserved.

Tools and environments – any custom tools, calibration data sets, or specific versions of third-party libraries/compilers required to build or operate the software (these may be documented and controlled to ensure reproducibility).

Documentation – user manuals, release notes, and this CM Plan itself (the CM Plan is under version control to track any updates).

Each configuration item is assigned a unique identifier and version label according to the project’s naming conventions. For example, software components might be identified by a naming scheme like SW_ComponentName_vX.Y.Z, requirements by IDs like REQ-1234, and documents by document codes and revision numbers. The plan ensures that each CI and its versions are uniquely named and tracked across all project baselines. A configuration registry (or item list) is maintained, listing all CIs along with their current version, status, and where they reside (e.g., repository path or document location).

Baseline Identification: A baseline is a snapshot of a set of CIs at a specific point, which serves as a reference for further development and can only be changed through formal change control. [Project Name] defines the following baselines (to be tailored as needed):

Development Baseline(s): Internal working baselines, such as at the end of each sprint or iteration. For example, after each sprint, a baseline of implemented features is labeled (e.g., Sprint_5_Baseline) for integration testing. These serve as checkpoints but may not be externally released.

Release Baseline: A formal baseline intended for release (to a customer or higher-level integration). This includes all software and artifacts approved for the release. Each release baseline gets a unique version identifier (e.g., ProjectName_v1.0 or a build number) and is archived. Prior to establishing a release baseline, a configuration audit is performed to ensure completeness (see Verification & Audit section).

Functional/Design Baselines (if applicable): In a V-model context, the project may set baselines on requirements or design. For instance, a Software Requirement Baseline could be established once requirements are approved, and a Design Baseline after high-level design is finalized. Changes to these baselines require change control as well, ensuring traceability from requirements to implementation. (These are optional and project-specific; Agile projects might instead continuously evolve requirements, in which case baselining occurs via backlogs and story freeze per iteration.)

Customer/Production Baseline: If the ECU software is delivered for production or vehicle integration, a final product baseline is established, capturing the exact versions of all items as built into the product. This baseline would be under strict change control for maintenance and support (any patches or updates are managed as new baseline versions).

For each baseline, the plan documents the criteria for inclusion (e.g., “all features for Milestone X implemented and tested”), and how baselines are labeled and stored. Baselines are typically recorded in the version control system with tags or in a CM tool as snapshots, and a baseline report is generated listing all included item versions and their identifiers.

Configuration Item Structure: The relationships and structure of CIs are identified at each control point. For example, the software components may be structured into subsystems, and each baseline might correspond to a system build that includes specific subsystem versions. A bill-of-materials style listing (or software BOM) may be used to represent an overall product configuration (especially if multiple components or a software + calibration set need to be combined). As recommended by Automotive SPICE, local baselines (for different domains like code, requirements, tests) can be combined into one overall baseline that describes the complete product configuration.

Access Control: Only authorized personnel have the rights to create or modify CIs in the repository (e.g., write access for developers to code, limited access for others). Access rights to the CM system are defined to protect the integrity of baselines (e.g., only the CM Manager can create official release tags).

Finally, this section should be updated as new CIs are identified or if the scope changes. It provides the foundation for subsequent CM activities by clearly defining “what” is being managed.

Change Control

Change control is the disciplined process of managing modifications to CIs, ensuring that each change is properly reviewed, approved, and documented. No configuration item in [Project Name] may be altered without following the change control process described here. This process aligns with the concept of change management in EIA-649 and IEEE 828, encompassing the proposal, analysis, decision, and implementation of changes.

Change Request (CR) Process: All requests for changes (such as new features, defect fixes, or updates to requirements) are recorded as formal Change Requests in the project’s tracking tool (e.g., JIRA, Azure DevOps, or a Change Management System). Each CR is uniquely identified (e.g., with an ID number) and contains details about the proposed change, the rationale, impacted items, and urgency/classification (e.g., critical, major, minor change).

The typical steps for processing a Change Request are:

Submission: A stakeholder (developer, tester, manager, or customer) submits a CR with a clear description of the desired change or issue. The CR should reference relevant CIs (by name or ID) and baseline if known (e.g., “found in version 1.0”).

Recording & Initial Review: The CR is recorded in the change tracking system, and the Configuration Manager (or a designated triage role) checks it for completeness. The CR is then given a status (e.g., “New”) and queued for evaluation.

Impact Analysis: Engineers (and other subject matter experts) perform an impact analysis of the change. This includes identifying all affected CIs (code modules, requirements documents, test cases, etc.), estimating effort, assessing risks and impact on schedule, and checking for overlap with other pending changes. Traceability records are used here to ensure all related items (e.g., requirements, design, tests) are considered.

CCB Review & Decision: The Change Control Board convenes (or uses an async review workflow) to discuss the CR. Based on the impact analysis and project priorities, the CCB decides to approve, reject, or defer the change.

If approved, the CR is prioritized and scheduled. The CCB may specify conditions or notes (e.g., “approved for next release” or “urgent patch”).

If rejected, the reason is documented (e.g., out of scope or not feasible), and the CR is closed without implementation.

If deferred, the CR remains open but is put on hold (e.g., pending more info or to be reconsidered in a future release).

Implementation: For approved changes, the assigned developer(s) implement the change in the identified CIs. They create a new version of the affected items in the version control system (see Version Control section) and ensure to link the code commit or update to the CR ID (this provides traceability from change request to actual change in the configuration item). All associated documentation and tests are updated accordingly as part of the change.

Verification & Closure: The implemented change is verified – this could involve code review, unit testing, integration testing, and/or regression testing as appropriate. Once the change is verified to meet its intent and not introduce unexpected issues, the QA or requester verifies the CR. The CR is then marked as “Closed” or “Resolved” in the tracking system. The configuration status is updated (the item’s new version is now part of the project configuration). If the change was significant, the project may establish a new baseline (especially if preparing for a release) to include this change under formal control.

All changes are recorded, and their history is maintained to provide a complete audit trail. For each change, the system captures who made the change, when it was made, and references to approvals (e.g., CCB meeting minutes or electronic approvals logged in the tool). This ensures “timely and thorough vetting and disposition of change requests” and “control and documentation of approved changes to baselines”.

The plan may designate certain levels of changes that require different approval paths. For example, minor changes (low impact, e.g., comment updates or trivial code fixes) might be pre-approved or batched, whereas major changes (impacting requirements or external behavior) require full CCB review and possibly stakeholder/customer concurrence. Similarly, emergency fixes (for critical bugs in production) might follow an expedited approval process (e.g., Project Manager + CM approval) but still must be retrospectively reviewed by the CCB.

Interface and Supplier Changes: If any CIs are provided by external parties (suppliers) or if the software interfaces with other systems, the plan should address how external changes are handled. For supplier-delivered components, their changes should be evaluated (e.g., through a Supplier CCB or by reviewing supplier release notes), and any update to those components should undergo compatibility verification before inclusion in the project baseline.

In summary, change control ensures that no change goes untracked or unchecked. By enforcing this process, [Project Name] avoids unauthorized modifications and maintains consistency between the product and its requirements throughout development and maintenance.

Configuration Status Accounting

Configuration Status Accounting (CSA) is the tracking and reporting function of CM: it records and reports the status of configuration items and change requests throughout the project. The goal is to have up-to-date information on the state of each baseline and each CI, providing insight for project management and audit purposes.

Status Recording: The project’s CM tools (version control, change tracking, etc.) serve as the primary sources for status data. For each configuration item, the system records its current version, last change date, who made the change, and its inclusion in baselines. For each Change Request, the tracking tool records its status (e.g., New, In Progress, Approved, Implemented, Closed), the version in which it was implemented, and link to affected CIs. Additional data that may be recorded includes build numbers, test status of a baseline, and known deviations or waivers.

Status Reporting: The Configuration Manager will produce periodic configuration status reports. These can be generated at key points (e.g., before a release, at the end of an iteration, or during a formal review). The reports typically include:

A list of all current CIs and their versions in the latest baseline (i.e., a baseline composition list).

The status of all Change Requests (e.g., how many are open, in progress, closed; possibly a burn-down chart of CRs for the release).

The status of baselines (e.g., “Baseline v2.0 – all features implemented, 2 known defects open (deferred), pending final test”).

Metrics such as the number of changes made in the last period, the rate of change, or the average time to close CRs – if those are useful for project monitoring.

Any configuration deviations or outstanding issues (for example, if an expected artifact wasn’t included in the baseline or if a change was implemented without proper approval, etc.).

By recording and reporting status of configuration items in this way, we support other processes like project management, integration, and QA. For instance, project management can use the status data to determine if the project is on track (e.g., are all planned changes for this release completed? Is anything not baselined yet?). During integration and testing, knowing exactly which versions of components are in a given test build (and what changes went into them) allows for quicker troubleshooting.

The CM Plan ensures that this status information is readily available to affected parties. In practice, much of status accounting is handled by tools: for example, a Git repository can show commit history (which is a form of status accounting for code changes), and a JIRA query can list all open change requests. The Configuration Manager might use these tools to compile an official report or dashboard. In a Streamlit UI or web context, this could even be an automated dashboard showing real-time configuration status.

Auditing Trail: Status accounting records provide the data needed for audits and reviews. The plan mandates keeping an audit trail of all changes – this means no deletion of records. Even when a CI is retired or a CR is rejected, the record remains in the system for traceability. For documentation, when a new revision supersedes an old one, the old revision is archived, not discarded, and its history is logged (who approved it, etc.).

In summary, configuration status accounting gives visibility into the configuration at any point in time. It answers questions like “What is the current version of component X and what changes does it include?”, “Has change Y been included in a released baseline?”, and “How many changes are planned for the next release?”. By maintaining these records, the project can assure stakeholders that the configuration is under control and can quickly retrieve information as needed.

Configuration Verification and Audit

Configuration verification and audit is the quality assurance aspect of CM, ensuring that the actual configurations conform to the intended design and that CM processes are followed. This domain covers activities to verify that information about configured items and baselines is complete, and to confirm the consistency of those baselines. In practice, this is achieved via formal and informal audits, reviews, and checks.

Baseline Verification: Each time a new baseline is established (especially for a release), the Configuration Manager verifies that all required items are included and correctly identified. For example, if the plan says a release baseline must include source code, compiled binary, release notes, and a test report, then a pre-release checklist is used to verify all these items are present and version-aligned. Any discrepancies (e.g., a document still at an older version) are resolved before finalizing the baseline. This ensures completeness of the baseline.

Functional and Physical Configuration Audits (FCA & PCA): The project will conduct configuration audits in line with best practices:

A Functional Configuration Audit (FCA) may be performed to verify that the functional characteristics of the software (as built) meet the requirements and that all requirements have been implemented and tested. This often ties in with a final test review – ensuring test results show all requirements are met, and any deviations are known. Essentially, it asks: does the product do what it's supposed to, and are all required work products in place? If [Project Name] is following a formal V-model, an FCA might be conducted at a system or software qualification test milestone. In Agile contexts, an FCA could be more incremental (e.g., verifying a subset of requirements at the end of each iteration), but a final FCA is done before a major release.

A Physical Configuration Audit (PCA) may be done to verify that the product’s “as-built” configuration matches the agreed design documentation and that all CIs are properly identified and have records. It checks that the baseline (e.g., source code, build, documents) is internally consistent and that you can regenerate the product from the configuration records. For example, PCA will confirm that the source code labeled as version 2.0 indeed builds the binary that is being released as 2.0, and that all supporting documents (like user manuals) correspond to that version.

Per IEEE 828 guidance, at minimum, a configuration audit shall be performed on a CI prior to its release. For [Project Name], this means before any official release, the CM team performs an audit (which can be seen as a combined FCA/PCA for the software system). The audit results are documented, noting any findings or corrective actions. Only when the audit is satisfactory (or any issues are resolved/waived by management) is the baseline designated as a released configuration.

Process Compliance Audits: In addition to product-focused audits, the CM process itself may be subject to audit (by internal QA or external assessors, e.g., for Automotive SPICE compliance). This checks whether change control procedures are being followed (e.g., every commit has a linked CR, every CR has approval), whether status accounting is up-to-date, and whether roles as defined are performing their tasks. Any non-compliance is recorded and addressed (e.g., through training or process correction).

Audit Schedule: The plan should define when audits occur. Typically:

Internal CM audits – e.g., just before a major release (as described), and perhaps mid-project if needed for large projects.

External or milestone audits – e.g., as part of a System Audit or a Quality Management audit. If the project is seeking Automotive SPICE level assessment, an assessor might examine CM records at any time.

Ongoing verification – The CM Specialist might do routine checks, such as weekly verification that no uncontrolled files exist outside the repository, or that backups are functioning (see Storage & Backup in Version Control section).

After each audit, a report is produced (or at least an email/minutes if informal), and action items are tracked to closure. The configuration status records (from the Status Accounting section) are often used as input to audits, and auditors may sample CIs to trace through their history (ensuring traceability and control were maintained).

By performing these verification and audit activities, [Project Name] ensures integrity of the configuration (i.e., what we have built is what we intended to build, and all changes are accounted for). This also instills confidence that over the vehicle ECU’s life (which in automotive can be long), the organization can reliably reproduce any given software version and understand its composition – a necessity since automotive products may need updates or investigations even many years after production.

Version Control

Version control is the backbone of configuration management for software. All software CIs in [Project Name] are maintained in a Version Control System (VCS) repository (e.g., Git, SVN, etc.), which provides the ability to track changes over time, compare versions, and collaborate on code. The repository for this project is [Repository Name/Tool] (e.g., GitLab, Bitbucket, or Subversion server), and all team members must use it for any changes to controlled items.

Repository Structure: The repository is organized to reflect the product structure. For example, there may be separate folders or modules for different components of the ECU software, a directory for documentation, and possibly a separate branch or repository for variant code if multiple product variants are supported. The top-level structure and naming conventions are documented here [insert or link repository structure diagram if available].

Branch and Merge Strategy: The project follows a defined branching strategy to allow parallel development while maintaining stability. The strategy is [describe strategy, e.g., Gitflow, trunk-based, or a simple main/develop branching]. For instance, a common approach is:

A main (or master) branch that always reflects the latest stable baseline (potentially the latest release or release-candidate).

A develop/integration branch where ongoing development is integrated (if using Gitflow).

Feature branches for new features or significant changes, which branch off develop (or main) and are merged back after review.

Release branches that fork from develop when preparing a release, allowing final bug fixes and then tagging the release baseline before merging back into main.

Hotfix branches from main for urgent fixes on released versions, which are later merged back.

All merges into integration or release branches should be done via peer-reviewed pull requests (merge requests), ensuring code reviews happen and only approved changes get merged. The CM plan specifies that merge conflicts must be resolved by the responsible developers, and if a conflict arises, “the person making the last change is responsible for performing a code review and resolving any conflicts” in coordination with others.

Labelling/Tagging: The VCS is used to label important milestones and baselines. When a baseline is established (especially a release baseline), a tag is created in the repository (e.g., v1.0.0_release). This tag marks the exact commit(s) that constitute that baseline, allowing anyone later to fetch the exact configuration. For multi-repository or multi-component projects, a manifest or combined tag might be used (sometimes a separate configuration management tool or manifest file lists which repo/tag of each component goes into a system release).

Version Numbering: [Project Name] uses a version numbering scheme for releases. The format is [describe scheme, e.g., semantic versioning MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH or a date-based or internal scheme]. For example, 1.2.0 might indicate Major version 1, second minor release, no patch; incrementing the major indicates significant changes or incompatible updates. Internal builds may use incremental build numbers or branch names (e.g., 1.2.0-beta3 for a third test build of upcoming 1.2.0). The version number is recorded in the software (e.g., as part of an about box or diagnostic info) and in documentation, ensuring traceability of delivered binaries to their source configuration.

Access and Permissions: The version control system implements permissions so that only authorized users can commit changes. Typically, all developers have commit access to certain branches (like their feature branches or the develop branch), but only the CM or integrator can merge to main/release branches, or only after approvals. The system may also enforce branch protections (like requiring code reviews or passing automated tests before merging).

Backup and Recovery: The repository is regularly backed up as part of the CM infrastructure. According to ASPICE best practices, we “manage the storage of configuration items and baselines” by scheduling backups and archiving to protect against data loss. Backup frequency [e.g., daily] and retention [e.g., keep for project duration + 5 years] are defined in the project’s IT policy. A Recovery plan is in place (and listed as an output work product in ASPICE) to restore configurations from backups in case of repository failure.

Revision History: The VCS automatically keeps a revision history for each file, which serves as the change log. Every commit message should be meaningful and, where applicable, include references to CR IDs or requirement IDs. This practice provides built-in traceability from changes back to their origin (requirement or defect) and is a key part of maintaining a robust audit trail.

Developers are expected to update the repository frequently and avoid large, monolithic commits. Each commit should represent a logical, self-contained change. This not only aids traceability but also makes merges and reviews easier.

By using a modern version control system with the above practices, [Project Name] ensures that there is one source of truth for the state of the software at any given time, and that parallel development can proceed in an organized manner with controlled integration points. This directly supports configuration identification, change control, and release management by providing the mechanisms to implement them.

Release Management

Release Management covers the steps and controls to formally package and deliver a set of configuration items as a release to an intended audience (whether an internal test team, an external customer, or production). In [Project Name], a “release” typically means delivering the ECU software binary (and any supporting files) along with documentation (release notes, user guide updates, etc.) at a defined version. This section describes how releases are planned, approved, and executed.

Release Planning: Each release is planned in terms of scope (which features/changes it includes) and schedule. High-level milestones (e.g., “Release 2.0 freeze by June, release to Vehicle Integration testing by July”) are defined by project management. The CM Plan ensures that configuration management activities align with these milestones – for example, having a code freeze date where no new features are merged, only bug fixes, leading up to a baseline.

Preparation of Release Baseline: When a release is due, the Configuration Manager (with the team) works to establish the release baseline in the version control system:

Ensure all intended changes (approved CRs) for the release have been implemented and merged into the release branch or main branch.

Run a final integration build of the software from the exact version to be released. This build should be reproducible at any time using the tagged source code and documented build process.

Verify the build by running the full test suite (automated tests, regression tests, etc.). All test results for this build are reviewed. Any critical defects found are either fixed (with another build/test cycle) or, if not fixed, are documented as known issues in the release notes and possibly deferred to a future release with CCB approval.

Generate release documentation: primarily Release Notes that summarize the new features, changes, fixed issues (with reference to CR IDs), any known limitations, and the configuration of the release (e.g., “Built from commit ABC123 on main branch, using Compiler X version Y, linking to Calibration Data set Z”, etc.). The release notes may also include instructions for deployment or installation of the ECU software. Other documents like updated user manuals or installation guides are also prepared if part of the deliverables.

Release Approval: Before an official release is made, a Release Review meeting (or CCB meeting) is held. In this review:

The CM Specialist presents the contents of the release (what’s in the baseline, what versions of each component, etc., essentially the configuration status report for the release).

QA/Test provides a summary of test results indicating whether the release meets quality criteria.

Any outstanding risks or issues are discussed (e.g., known bugs).

The CCB (or a specific Release Board including project and product stakeholders) formally approves the release. This might be documented by signing a release approval form or via meeting minutes. If the project requires, this step can also involve customer or management approval especially for external releases.

Only after approval is the baseline considered a released configuration. At that point, the baseline is locked down (tagged) and archived. Per policy, “a configuration audit shall be performed on a CI prior to its release” – effectively, the release review combined with a final configuration audit ensures the release is solid.

Distribution and Deployment: The release package (software binaries, release notes, etc.) is then distributed to the intended recipients:

For an internal test release, this might mean uploading the software to a test server or providing it to the vehicle integration lab.

For a customer release, the package may be delivered through a secure file transfer or posted on a customer portal.

Proper labeling is done on the delivered files (e.g., the binary might be embedded with version info, and the file name includes version). If applicable, digital signatures or checksums are provided to ensure integrity of the delivered files.

The plan also covers post-release activities:

The repository might branch at the release tag for possible future patch maintenance (e.g., creating a v2.0.x maintenance branch separate from ongoing development).

All records of the release (baseline contents, approvals, test results) are stored in the project archive. This satisfies any audit or compliance requirements (for example, proving to an assessor or customer that the release went through proper CM and QA).

If the release is going to a safety-critical system or requires regulatory compliance, additional evidence (like traceability matrices, compliance reports) are compiled at release and placed under configuration control as part of the release baseline.

Emergency Release Handling: In case an urgent fix needs to be released (outside the normal schedule), the plan allows for an emergency release process. This typically uses a hotfix branch from the last released baseline, implements the fix, does a quick targeted test, and then goes through an expedited approval (Project Manager and QA lead at minimum) to release the patch. The emergency release is then documented and later merged back into the main line. Even in emergency scenarios, configuration management principles apply – the change must be tracked via a CR, tested, tagged, and recorded to maintain the integrity of the configuration history.

By managing releases in this structured way, [Project Name] ensures that each software release is a known, reproducible entity. Stakeholders can have confidence that any given release has a defined composition and has passed through all necessary controls. Release management, as part of CM, links closely with change control (to decide what goes in a release), status accounting (to know release readiness), and verification (to validate the release quality). It is the culmination of CM activities for a development cycle, resulting in a product increment delivered to its users.

Traceability

Traceability in configuration management refers to the ability to trace relationships between requirements, configuration items, changes, and tests across the project’s lifecycle. In the context of [Project Name] (an automotive ECU software project), maintaining traceability is crucial for understanding the impact of changes, verifying completeness, and demonstrating compliance with processes like Automotive SPICE and safety standards.

Requirements Traceability: Each requirement (whether system-level or software-specific) is linked to design elements, implementation (code) units, and test cases. The project’s requirements management tool ([name if applicable]) is used to record these links. For example, a requirement ID can be referenced in the code (in comments or commit messages) and in test case descriptions. This allows us to answer: Which code modules implement this requirement? Has it been tested? Ensuring traceability of designs to requirements is one of the benefits of CM activities.

Change Traceability: Every Change Request is associated with the specific CIs it proposes to change. When the CR is implemented, the commit messages include the CR ID, and the CR record is updated with the version in which it was resolved.

This is important for auditing and for understanding why a particular change exists in the code (the rationale). It also helps during debugging or review to find related changes.

Baseline Traceability: The plan ensures that
